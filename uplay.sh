WINEPREFIX=~/uplay/prefix/location/ wine '/home/username/uplay/location/upc.exe'

You need to add the same WINEESYNC=1 or WINEFSYNC=1 thing as you did to the far
cry script, again the same rules apply here, so go look at the other script.

Nothing else is needed here. So just edit the locations, and add esync or
fsync depending on which one you added to the far cry script.
